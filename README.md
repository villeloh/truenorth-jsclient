# TrueNorth -- Cycling Made Easy

If you've ever tried to use Google Maps while cycling, you'll know that it's far from ideal for that purpose.
This Android app aims to avoid the worst pitfalls, while keeping all the useful features and adding a 
few handy new ones.

##Current Features

* Map orientation can never change; North will always be up, hence the name of the app.

* No annoying popups about recommended caf√©s etc, nor any voice guidance.

* Waypoints can be added with double-taps, moved around by dragging, and deleted with a double-tap.

* Long-press or drag to alter the destination.

* Route steepness is indicated by color (red for uphill, blue for downhill).

* Route length and travel time are shown in the top center of the screen.

* Travel mode can be changed between cycling and walking (good for tunnels, where cycling mode doesn't work).

* (Average) speed can be chosen between 1-50 km/h, altering the travel time.

* Normal map view, satellite view and terrain view are available, just like in regular Google Maps.

* Cancel the route easily with one button.

##Planned Features

* Moving the starting location (to plan for future routes).

* Saving your favorite routes (locally at first; perhaps online later).

* Optimization (the app runs slowly due to various things atm).

## Installation?

At present, the app is for personal use only. When I've polished it enough, I may make it available for more people.
