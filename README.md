# TrueNorth -- Cycling Made Easy

If you've ever tried to use Google Maps while cycling, you'll know my headaches.

* Minimize the app and when you come back, the zoom level and/or map bearing has altered, throwing your sense of direction into orbit with a wicked side-spin? Check.

* A huge banner about recommended cafés and tourist spots blocking you're view when you're rounding a tight corner? Check.

* Can't add waypoints or move the destination marker in the mobile version, even though both features are sorely needed? Check.

* A million clicks to cancel a route, and seemingly a million ways to start a useless voice commentary to drown out your favorite riding music? Checkity-check McCheckFace.

When finished, all of these headaches and more will be eliminated by the TrueNorth app. 
A clean & simple UI, with no bells or whistles, will help you get from point A to point B with a minimum of fuss on the way.
You'll be able to add and remove waypoints and move the destination marker, yet avoid doing so by misclick. The app won't do your zooming for
you, it can't talk to you, and you literally CAN'T spin the map around. As it says in the app title, the North will always be TRUE with TrueNorth.

## Installation?

For God's sake don't try to install it yet; I'll tell you when it's in a good enough shape for that. Better yet, I'll publish the app on the PlayStore for your no-mess, no-fuss, easy downloading pleasure.
